These backends are designed to handle concurrent access and locking efficiently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure Lock Timeout: Set an appropriate lock timeout in your backend configuration. This timeout specifies how long a lock can be held before it is automatically released, ensuring that locks are not held indefinitely, even in case of unexpected failures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enable Encryption: If your remote state backend supports encryption (e.g., S3 with server-side encryption), enable it to protect sensitive infrastructure details in transit and at rest.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider State File Segmentation: In large-scale environments, consider segmenting your state files into smaller pieces to reduce contention for locks. This can be achieved by using workspaces or creating multiple state files for different components or environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automate Locking and Unlocking: Implement automation scripts or processes that handle locking and unlocking for you. This can help avoid manual mistakes and ensure that locks are consistently acquired and released.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document Locking Procedures: Clearly document your organization's locking procedures, including who is responsible for acquiring and releasing locks, how to handle lock timeouts or errors, and any backup procedures in case of issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Monitor Locking Activity: Implement monitoring and alerting for locking activity to detect any anomalies or issues with state locking in real-time.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test Locking Scenarios: Test your state locking mechanisms and procedures under various scenarios, including simulated conflicts and failures, to ensure that they work as expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Backup and Version Control: Regularly back up your Terraform state and use version control systems like Git to track changes to your infrastructure code.

This is especially important for unstructured data like logs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Processing: Splunk processes each event to extract metadata and assign timestamp information. This metadata includes source, sourcetype, host, and timestamp, which are used for searching and filtering.</p> </li> <li> <p>Indexing: The processed events are then indexed. Splunk indexes are typically stored as flat files on disk, optimized for rapid searching. Each index has its own set of files and directories associated with it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Index Storage: Splunk uses a storage mechanism known as \"buckets\" to store indexed data. Each bucket represents a specific time interval, and data within the bucket is organized by timestamp. Buckets can be hot, warm, cold, or frozen, depending on data access patterns and retention policies.</p> </li> <li> <p>Search and Retrieval: When a user performs a search in Splunk, the search query is executed against the indexes. Splunk's indexers and search heads work together to retrieve relevant events quickly.</p> </li> <li> <p>Search Optimization: Splunk employs various optimization techniques, such as indexing summaries (tsidx files), to accelerate searches. It uses the timestamp and event metadata to filter and rank results efficiently.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data Retention: Indexes can have data retention policies defined. Data can be automatically rolled to colder storage or deleted after a specified period, helping manage storage costs and compliance requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Access Control: Splunk allows administrators to define access controls at the index level. This ensures that only authorized users can access specific data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Load Balancing: In distributed Splunk deployments, data can be distributed across multiple indexers, and load balancing ensures that the data is evenly distributed for efficient indexing and searching.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, Splunk indexing is a core component of its data processing pipeline. It involves ingesting, parsing, indexing, and storing event data in a structured and optimized manner, enabling users to perform fast and efficient searches, analysis, and reporting on the collected data. Indexes are customizable and can be configured to meet the specific needs of an organization, making Splunk a flexible and powerful platform for data analytics and insights.</p>","tags":["Prometheus","Grafana","ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)","Splunk","New Relic","Datadog"]},{"location":"devops/logging/#splunk-dashboards","title":"Splunk Dashboards","text":"<p>A Splunk dashboard is a customizable, web-based interface that allows users to visualize and present data from Splunk searches and queries.

Lambda expressions let you express instances of single-method interfaces (referred to as functional interfaces) more compactly.</li> <li>Method references : Method references provide easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.</li> <li>Pipelines and Streams New stream API to facilitate pipeline processing.</li> <li>Functional interfaces : An Interface that contains only one abstract method is known as functional interface. It can have any number of default and static methods. It can also declare methods of object class.</li> <li>Date and Time API: Date and Time API give us a  new package java.time package.</li> <li>Default Methods: Default methods enable new functionality to be added to the interfaces of libraries and ensure binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.</li> <li>Type Annotations: Before Java 8 Java annotations can be applied to type declarations. From this Java 8 release onwards, annotations can be applied to type use. Annotations can be applied wherever a type is used like in new instance creates, exception throws clause etc. This will help to enforce stronger type checks and using this feature we can come up with a type checking framework itself.</li> <li>Nashorn JavaScript Engine: Using this we can develop standalone JavaScript applications in Java. Pre Java 8, we got JDK with a JavaScript engine based on Rhino. It is a developed from scratch. It will provide better compatibility with ECMA normalized JavaScript specification and better performance than Rhino.</li> <li>Concurrent Accumulators: java.util.concurrent.atomic package is getting additional classes as part of Java 8 release. These will help to sum values from across multiple threads.</li> <li>Parallel operations: Iterating over a collection can be done in parallel using the aggregate operations easily. Pre Java 8 Iterators are used to parse the elements of a collection one by on explicitly. Now that can be done in parallel internally with the use of streams and aggregate operations. We can create multiple substreams and those substreams can be processed internally in parallel and then the results be combined. For this to be effective, we need to have multiple cores and data volume.</li> <li>PermGen Space Removed: The PermGen space is removed from Java 8 and instead we have MetaSpace introduced. One of the most dreaded error, \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen error will no longer be seen from Java 8. Nice thing is that the MetaSpace default is unlimited and that the system memory itself becomes the memory.</li> <li>TLS SNI : Server Name Indentification (SNI) is an extension of the TLS protocol used for identifying the certificate to serve based on the hostname specified by the client. This enables a server to have virtual host over HTTPS. The same IP address can be used for multiple hosts and their respective different security certificates.</li> <li>Optional  : Emphasis on best practices to handle null values properly.</li> <li>Collection API improvements: Some new methods added in Collection API Iterator default method forEachRemaining(Consumer action),Collection default method removeIf(Predicate filter)</li> <li>Concurrency API improvements: ConcurrentHashMap compute(), forEach(), forEachEntry(), forEachKey(), forEachValue(), merge(), reduce() and search() methods.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"java/java-basics/#why-string-is-immutable","title":"Why String is Immutable?","text":"<p>String is immutable for below reasons:</p> <ul> <li>String Pool : String Pool is possible only because String is Immutable in Java. String pool is a special storage area in Java heap. If the string is already present in the pool, then instead of creating a new object, old object\u2019s reference is returned. This way different String variables can refer to the same reference in the pool, thus saving a lot of heap space also. If String is not immutable then changing the string with one reference will lead to the wrong values to other string variables having the same reference.</li> <li>Security : String parameters are used in network connections, database URL\u2019s, username and passwords etc. Because String is immutable, these values can\u2019t be changed. Otherwise any hacker could change the referenced values which will cause severe security issues in the application.</li> <li>Multi-threading : Since String is immutable, it is safe for multithreading. A single String instance can be shared across different threads. This avoids the use of synchronization for thread safety. Strings are implicitly thread-safe.</li> <li>Caching : The hashcode of string is frequently used in Java. Since string is immutable, the hashcode will remain the same, so it can be cached without worrying about the changes. This makes it a great candidate for using it as a Key in Map.</li> <li>Class Loaders : Strings are used in Java ClassLoaders and since String is made immutable, it provides security that correct class is being loaded.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"java/java-basics/#stringbuffer-and-stringbuilder","title":"StringBuffer and StringBuilder","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Both StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used for String manipulation.

It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true. It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.

If you override one, you should override the other. In most cases, if you override the equals() method, you should also override the hashCode() method to ensure that objects that are equal according to the equals() method have the same hash code.</p> <p>Additionally, it is recommended to follow the conventions outlined in the Java API documentation and in the book \"Effective Java\" by Joshua Bloch when implementing these methods. This will ensure that your code works well with the standard Java libraries and APIs.</p> <p>In summary, the hashCode() and equals() methods are important tools for determining the equality of objects in Java.

It is designed to reclaim memory with minimal pauses and is optimized for large heaps.</p> <p>These are some of the most commonly used garbage collection algorithms in Java. The specific algorithm used by the JVM can be configured by setting command line options when starting the JVM. The appropriate garbage collector to use depends on the specific requirements of the application and the environment in which it runs.</p> <p>The Garbage Collector has only two things to do:</p> <ul> <li>Find garbage - unused objects. (An object is considered unused if none of the entities in the code currently executing contains references to it, or the chain of links that could connect the object with some application entity is broken);</li> <li>Free memory from garbage.</li> </ul> <p>There are two approaches to detecting garbage: - Reference counting ; - Tracing</p> <p>Counting the Reference (reference counting). The essence of this approach is that each object has a counter. A counter stores information about how many references are pointing to an object. When the link is destroyed, the counter is decremented. If the counter value is zero, the object can be considered garbage. The main disadvantage of this approach is the difficulty of ensuring the accuracy of the meter. Also, with this approach, it is difficult to detect circular dependencies (when two objects point to each other, but no living object refers to them), which leads to memory leaks.</p> <p>The main idea of the Tracing approach (tracing) is the assertion that only those objects that we can reach from the root points ( GC Root ) and those objects that are accessible from the living object can be considered alive. Everything else is rubbish.</p> <p>There are 4 types of root points: - Local variables and method parameters; - Streams; - Static variables; - Links from JNI.</p> <p>The simplest java application will have root points:</p> <ul> <li>Local variables inside the main()method and main()method parameters ;</li> <li>The thread that executes main();</li> <li>Static variables of the class inside which the main() method is located .</li> </ul> <p>Thus, if we represent all objects and links between them as a tree, then we will need to go from root nodes (points) along all edges. At the same time, the nodes that we can get to are not garbage, all the rest are garbage. With this approach, cyclical dependencies are easily identified. HotSpot VM takes exactly this approach.</p> <p>There are two main methods for cleaning up memory from garbage:</p> <ul> <li>Copying collectors</li> <li>Mark-and-sweep</li> </ul> <p>With the copying collectors approach, memory is divided into two parts \"from-space\" and \"to-space\", while the principle of operation is as follows: - Objects are created in \"from-space\"; - When the \"from-space\" is full, the application is suspended; - The garbage collector starts. Live objects are found in \"from-space\" and copied to \"to-space\"; - When all objects are copied, \"from-space\" is completely cleared; - \"To-space\" and \"from-space\" are swapped.</p> <p>The main advantage of this approach is that objects densely clog up memory. Cons of the approach:</p> <ol> <li>The application must be stopped for the time it takes to complete the garbage collection cycle;</li> <li>In the worst case (when all objects are alive) \"form-space\" and \"to-space\" will have to be the same size.</li> </ol> <p>The mark-and-sweep algorithm can be described as: - Objects are created in memory; - At the moment when the garbage collector needs to be started, the application is suspended; - The collector walks through the object tree, marking live objects; - The collector loops through the entire memory, finding all unmarked chunks of memory and storing them in the \"free list\"; - When new objects start to be created they are created in memory available in the \"free list\"</p> <p>Cons of this method: The application does not run while garbage collection is in progress; The stopping time directly depends on the size of the memory and the number of objects; If you do not use \"compacting\" the memory will not be used efficiently. The HotSpot VM garbage collectors use a combined Generational Garbage Collection approach that allows different algorithms to be used for different stages of garbage collection. This approach relies on the fact that:</p> <p>most objects created quickly become garbage; there are few links between objects that were created in the past and newly created objects.</p>"},{"location":"java/java-basics/#how-does-the-garbage-collector-work","title":"How does the garbage collector work?","text":"<p>Garbage collection is the process of freeing space on the heap so that new objects can be added.</p> <p>Objects are created through the operator new, thereby assigning a reference to the object. To finish working with an object, you just need to stop referring to it, for example, by assigning a reference to another object or value to a variable null; terminate the execution of the method so that its local variables expire naturally. Objects, links to which are not usually called garbage ( garbage ), which will be removed.</p> <p>The Java virtual machine, using the garbage collection mechanism, ensures that any object that has references remains in memory - all objects that are unreachable from the executable code, due to the lack of references to them, are deleted, freeing the memory allocated for them. More precisely, an object is outside the scope of the garbage collection process if it is reachable through a chain of links starting at the GC Root , i.e. a link that directly exists in the executable code.</p> <p>Memory is freed by the garbage collector at its own discretion. The program can successfully complete its work without exhausting the resources of free memory or not even approaching this limit, and therefore it will not need the \"services\" of the garbage collector.</p> <p>Garbage is collected by the system automatically, without user or programmer intervention, but this does not mean that this process does not require attention at all. The need to create and delete a large number of objects has a significant impact on the performance of applications and, if program performance is an important factor, you should carefully consider decisions related to the creation of objects - this, in turn, will reduce the amount of garbage to be disposed of.</p>"},{"location":"java/java-basics/#types-of-garbage-collectors","title":"Types of garbage collectors","text":"<p>The Java HotSpot VM provides four different garbage collectors to choose from:</p> <ul> <li>Serial is the easiest option for applications with low data volume and low latency requirements.

An unused object or unreferenced object, is no longer referenced by any part of your program.</p> <p>Garbage collector is a daemon thread that keeps running in the background, freeing up heap memory by destroying the unreachable objects.</p> <p>There was an analysis done on several applications which showed that most objects are short lived, so this behavior was used to improve the performance of JVM. In this method, the heap space is divided into smaller parts or generations. These are, Young Generation , Old or Tenured Generation and Permanent Generation .</p> <p>The Young Generation is where all new objects are allocated and aged. The young generation is further divided into 3 parts: Eden Space, Survivor space S0 and Survivor space S1. When the young generation fills up, this causes a minor garbage collection . Some surviving objects are aged and eventually move to the old generation. All minor garbage collections are \"Stop the World\" events. This means that all application threads are stopped until the operation completes. Minor garbage collections are always Stop the World events.</p> <p>The Old Generation is used to store long surviving objects. Typically, a threshold is set for young generation object and when that age is met, the object gets moved to the old generation. Eventually the old generation needs to be collected. This event is called a major garbage collection . Major garbage collection are also Stop the World events. Often a major collection is much slower because it involves all live objects. So, for Responsive applications, major garbage collections should be minimized. Also note that the length of the Stop the World event for a major garbage collection is affected by the kind of garbage collector that is used for the old generation space.</p> <p>The Permanent generation contains metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. The permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes in use by the application. In addition, Java SE library classes and methods may be stored here.</p> <p>Classes may get collected (unloaded) if the JVM finds they are no longer needed and space may be needed for other classes. </p> <p>The Permanent generation contains metadata required by the JVM to describe the classes and methods used in the application. The permanent generation is populated by the JVM at runtime based on classes in use by the application. In addition, Java SE library classes and methods may be stored here.</p> <p>Classes may get collected (unloaded) if the JVM finds they are no longer needed and space may be needed for other classes. The permanent generation is included in a full garbage collection. And Perm Gen was available till Java 7, it is removed from Java 8 onwards and JVM uses native memory for the representation of class metadata which is called MetaSpace.</p> <p>There is a flag MaxMetaspaceSize, to limit the amount of memory used for class metadata. If we do not specify the value for this, the Metaspace re-sizes at runtime as per the demand of the running application.</p> <p>How Garbage collection works:</p> <p>When new objects are first created, they are stored in the eden space of Young Generation and at that time both Survivor spaces are empty. When the eden space is filled, then a minor garbage collection is triggered. All the unused or un-referenced objects are cleared from the eden space and the used objects are moved to first Survivor space S0.</p> <p>At the next minor garbage collection, same process happens, un-referenced objects are cleared from the eden space but this time, the surviving objects are moved to Survivor space S1. In addition, the objects that were in S0 will also be matured and they also get moved to S1. Once all surviving objects are moved to S1, both eden and S0 are cleared.</p> <p>At the next minor GC, the same process repeats. When surviving objects reached a certain threshold, they get promoted from Young generation to Old generation. These minor GC will continue to occur and objects will continue to be promoted to the Old generation.</p> <p>Eventually, a major GC will be performed on the Old generation which cleans up and compacts the space.</p> <p>Types of Garbage collector</p> <p>Serial GC: Serial GC is designed for smaller applications that have small heap sizes of up to a few hundred MBs. It only uses single virtual CPU for its garbage collection and the collection is done serially. It takes around couple of second for Full garbage collections.</p> <p>It can be turned on by using <code>-XX:+UseSerialGC</code></p> <p>java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar C:\\temp\\test.jar</p> <p>Parallel/Throughput GC:</p> <p>Parallel garbage collector uses multiple threads to perform the garbage collection. By default, on a host with N CPUs, this collector uses N garbage collector threads for collection. </p> <p>The number of collector threads can be controlled with the command line option: <code>-XX:ParallelGCThreads=&lt;N&gt;</code></p> <p>It is called Throughput collector as it uses multiple CPUs to speed up the application throughput. A drawback of this collector is that it pauses the application threads while performing minor or full GC, so it is best suited for applications where long pauses are acceptable. It is the default collector in JDK 8.</p> <p>It can be turned on by using below 2 options:</p> <p>-XX:+UseParallelGC</p> <p>With this command line option, you get a multi-thread young generation collector with a single-threaded old generation collector. The option also does single-threaded compaction of old generation.</p> <p>java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:Max-PermSize=20m -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar C:\\temp\\test.jar</p> <p><code>-XX:+UseParallelOldGC</code></p> <p>With this option, the GC is both a multithreaded young generation collector and multithreaded old generation collector. It is also a multithreaded compacting collector.</p> <p>Compacting describes the act of moving objects in a way that there are no holes between objects. After a garbage collection sweep, there may be holes left between live objects. Compacting moves objects so that there are no remaining holes. This compacting of memory makes it faster to allocate new chunks of memory to the heap.</p> <p>java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:MaxPermSize=20m -XX:+UseParallelOldGC -jar C:\\temp\\test.jar</p> <p>Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector:</p> <p>The CMS collector, also called as the concurrent low pause collector, collects the tenured generation. It attempts to minimize the pauses due to garbage collection, by doing most of the garbage collection work concurrently with the application threads.</p> <p>It can be turned on by passing -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC in the command line option.</p> <p>If you want to set number of threads with this collector, pass -XX:ParallelCMSThreads= <p>java -Xmx12m -Xms3m -Xmn1m -XX:PermSize=20m -XX:Max-PermSize=20m -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:ParallelCMSThreads=2 -jar C:\\temp\\test.jar</p> <p>G1 Garbage Collector:</p> <p>The Garbage First or G1 collector is a parallel, concurrent and incrementally compacting low-pause garbage collector</p> <p>G1 collector partitions the heap into a set of equal-sized heap regions. When G1 performs garbage collection then a concurrent global marking phase is performed to determine the liveliness of objects throughout the heap. After this mark phase is complete, G1 knows which regions are mostly empty. It collects unreachable objects from these regions first, which usually yields a large amount of free space, also called Sweeping. So G1 collects these regions (containing garbage) first, and hence the name Garbage-First.</p> <p>It can be turned on by passing <code>-XX:+UseG1GC</code> in the command line options</p> <p>java \u2013Xmx25g \u2013Xms5g -XX:+UseG1GC -jar C:\\temp\\test.jar</p> <p>Java 8 has introduced one JVM parameter for reducing the unnecessary use of memory by creating too many instances of the same String. This optimizes the heap memory by removing duplicate String values to a global single char[] array. We can use the <code>-XX:+UseStringDeduplication</code> JVM argument to enable this optimization.</p> <p>G1 is the default garbage collector in JDK 9.</p> <p>Also Check: https://java2blog.com/garbage-collection-java/</p>"},{"location":"java/java-basics/#final-finally-and-finalize","title":"final, finally and finalize()","text":"BASIS FOR COMPARISON FINAL Keyword FINALLY Block FINALIZE Method Basic Final is a <code>Keyword</code> and <code>access modifier</code> in Java.

This creates a deep copy but does require that all keys and values in the HashMap are Serializable. Main advantage of this approach is that it will deep copy any arbitrary object graph.

For example, if you have a sealed class, you can specify different permitted subclasses in its subclasses.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>non-sealed</code> Modifier: In some cases, you may want to allow unrestricted extension or implementation for a specific class or interface. You can use the <code>non-sealed</code> modifier to achieve this:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>public non-sealed interface UnrestrictedInterface {\n    // Interface members\n}\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Compatibility with Older Code: When using sealed classes and interfaces in newer versions of Java, consider the compatibility of your code with older Java versions.

That is why these methods are defined in the Object class.</p> <p>Threads have no specific knowledge of each other. They can run asynchronously and are independent. They do not need to know about the status of other threads. They just need to call notify method on an object, so whichever thread is waiting on that resource will be notified.</p> <p>Let\u2019s consider this with a real-life example:</p> <p>Suppose there is a petrol pump and it has a single washroom, the key of which is kept at the service desk. This washroom is a shared resource for all. To use this shared resource, the user must acquire the key to the washroom lock. So, the user goes to service desk, acquires the key, opens the door, locks it from the inside and use the facility.</p> <p>Meanwhile if another user arrives at the petrol pump and wants to use the washroom, he goes to the washroom and found that it is locked. He goes to the service desk and the key is not there because it is with the current user. When the current user finishes, he unlocks the door and returns the key to the service desk. He does not bother about the waiting users. The service desk gives the key to waiting user. If there are more than one user waiting to use the facility, then they must form a queue.</p> <p>Now, apply this analogy to Java, one user is one thread and the washroom is the shared resource which the threads wish to execute. The key will be synchronized keyword provided by Java through which thread acquires a lock for the code it wants to execute and making other threads wait until the current thread finishes. Java will not be as fair as the service station, because any of the waiting threads may get a chance to acquire the lock, regardless of the order in which the threads came. The only guarantee is that all the waiting threads will get to use the shared resource sooner or later.</p> <p>In this example, the lock can be acquired on the key object or the service desk and none of them is a thread. These are the objects that decide whether the washroom is locked or not.</p>"},{"location":"java/multi-threading/#why-wait-notify-notifyall-methods-must-be-called-from-synchronized-block","title":"Why wait(), notify(), notifyAll() methods must be called from synchronized block?","text":"<p>These methods are used for inter-thread communication.

We can also use single-thread pools. - ExecutorService has methods to execute thread pools that either take a Runnable or Callable task. A Callable returns a result and throws a checked exception. - The submit() method returns a Future object that represents the result of the task (if the task is a Runnable, null is returned). - An executor has to be shutdown to close the pool thread with either shutdown() (gracefully) or shutdownNow() (forcefully). - A deadlock situation occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to acquire/release some resource. - Starvation happens when a thread is constantly waiting for a lock, never able to take it because other threads with higher priority are continually acquiring it. - A livelock is like a deadlock in the sense that two (or more) threads are blocking each other, but in a livelock, each thread tries to resolve the problem on its own (live) instead of just waiting (dead). - A race condition is a situation where two threads compete to access or modify the same resource at the same time in a way that causes unexpected results.</p>"},{"location":"java/multi-threading/#high-level-concurrency-features-executor-framework","title":"High level concurrency features Executor framework","text":"<ul> <li>ExecutorService Interface</li> <li>ScheduledExecutorService Interface</li> <li>Future Interface</li> <li>Executors newSingleThreadExecutor Method </li> <li>Executors newFixedThreadPool Method </li> <li>Executors newCachedThreadPool Method </li> <li>Executors newScheduledThreadPool Method </li> </ul>"},{"location":"java/multi-threading/#executor-interface","title":"Executor Interface","text":"<p>An object that executes submitted Runnable tasks.

It's similar to the Runnable interface, but offers two improvements, which are as follows: - 1. The main method of this interface, named call(), may return a result. - 2. When you send a Callable object to an executor, you get an object that implements the Future interface. You can use this object to control the status and the result of the Callable object.</p> <p>Executor Framework is an abstraction to managing multiple threads by yourself. So, it decouples the execution of a task and the actual task itself. Now, we just have to focus on the task that means, only implement the Runnables and submit them to executor. Then these runnables will be managed by the executor framework. It is available from Java 1.5 onwards.</p> <p>Also, we don\u2019t have to create new threads every time. With executor framework, we use Thread pools. Think of Thread Pool as a user-defined number of threads which are called worker threads, these are kept alive and reused. The tasks that are submitted to the executor will be executed by these worker threads. If there are more tasks than the threads in the pool, they can be added in a Queue and as soon as one of thread is finished with a task, it can pick the next one from this Queue or else, it will be added back in the pool waiting for a task to be assigned.</p> <p>So, it saves the overhead of creating a new thread for each task. If you are thinking about what is the problem with creating a new thread every time we want to execute a task, then you should know that creating a thread is an expensive operation. Thread objects use a significant amount of memory, and in a large-scale application, allocating and deallocating many thread objects creates a significant memory management overhead and new threads without any throttling will lead to the creation of large number of threads. These threads will cause wastage of resources.</p> <p>There are 2 main interfaces that you must know, one is <code>Executor</code> and the other is <code>ExecutorService</code>.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Executor : interface contains <code>execute(Runnable task)</code> method through which you can execute only Runnables. Also, the return type of <code>execute()</code> method is void, since you are passing a <code>Runnable</code> to it and it does not return any result back.</p> </li> <li> <p>ExecutorService : interface contains the <code>submit()</code> method which can take both <code>Runnable</code> and <code>Callable</code>, and its return type is Future object. <code>ExecutorService</code> extends the <code>Executor</code> Interface, so it also has the <code>execute()</code> method.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s look at different types of Executors:</p> <ul> <li>SingleThreadExecutor :   This executor has only one thread and is used to execute tasks in a sequential manner. If the thread dies due to an exception while executing the task, a new thread is created to replace the old thread and the subsequent tasks are executed in the new thread.   How to create a SingleThreadExecutor:</li> </ul> <p><pre><code>  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor ();\n</code></pre>   Executors is a utility class which contains many factory methods to create different types of ExecutorService, like the one called SingleThreadExecutor, we just created.</p> <ul> <li>FixedThreadPoolExecutor :   As its name suggests, this is an executor with a fixed number of threads. The tasks submitted to this executor are executed by the specified number of threads and if there are more tasks than the number of threads, then those tasks will be added in a queue (e.g. LinkedBlockingQueue).   How to create a FixedThreadPoolExecutor: <pre><code>  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool (5);\n</code></pre></li> </ul> <p>Here, we have created a thread pool executor of 5 threads, that means at any given time, 5 tasks can be managed by this executor. If there are more active tasks, they will be added to a queue until one of the 5 threads becomes free.   An important advantage of the fixed thread pool is that applications using it degrade gracefully. </p> <p>To understand this, consider a web server application where each HTTP request is handled by a separate thread. If the application simply creates a new thread for every new HTTP request, and the system receives more requests than it can handle immediately, the application will suddenly stop responding to all requests when the overhead of all those threads exceed the capacity of the system. With a limit on the number of the threads that can be created, the application will not be servicing HTTP requests as quickly as they come in, but it will be servicing them as quickly as the system can sustain.</p> <ul> <li> <p>CachedThreadPoolExecutor :   This executor is mainly used when there are many short-lived tasks to be executed. If you compare this with the fixed thread pool, here the number of threads of this executor pool is not bounded. If all the threads are busy executing the assigned tasks and if there is a new task, then a new thread will be created and added to the pool. If a thread remains idle for close to sixty seconds, it is terminated and removed from the cache.   Use this one, if you are sure that the tasks will be short-lived, otherwise there will be a lot of threads in the pool which will lead to performance issues.   How to create a CachedThreadPoolExecutor: <pre><code>  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool ();\n</code></pre></p> </li> <li> <p>ScheduledExecutor :   Use this executor, when you want to schedule your tasks, like run them at regular intervals or run them after a given delay. There are 2 methods which are used for scheduling tasks: scheduleAtFixedRate and scheduleWithFixedDelay .   How to create ScheduledExecutor:</p> </li> </ul> <p><pre><code>  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool (4);\n</code></pre>   ScheduledExecutorService interface extends the ExecutorService interface.   Now, apart from using Executors class to create executors, you can use ThreadPoolExecutor and ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor class also. Using these classes, you can manually configure and fine-tune various parameters of the executor according to your need. </p> <p>Let\u2019s see at some of those parameters:</p> <pre><code>  public ThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize,\n        int maximumPoolSize,\n        long keepAliveTime,\n        TimeUnit unit,\n        BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; workQueue,\n        ThreadFactory threadFactory,\n        RejectedExecutionHandler handler)\n</code></pre> <p>Core and Max Pool sizes:</p> <p>A ThreadPoolExecutor will automatically adjust the pool size according to the bounds set by corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize</p> <p>When a new task is submitted to the executor then:</p> <ul> <li>If the number of threads running are less than the corePoolSize, a new thread is created to handle the request</li> <li>If the number of threads running are more than corePoolSize but less than maximumPoolSize then a new thread will be created only if the queue is full</li> </ul> <p>Let\u2019s understand this with an example:</p> <p>You have defined the core pool size as 5, maximum pool size as 10 and the queue capacity as 100. Now as tasks are coming in, new threads will be created up to 5, then other new tasks will be added to queue until it reaches 100. Now when the queue is full and if new tasks are coming in, threads will be created up to the maximumPoolSize i.e. 10. Once all the threads are in use and the queue is also full, the new tasks will be rejected. As the queue reduces, so does the number of active threads.</p> <p>Keep Alive Time and TimeUnit:</p> <p>When the number of threads are greater than the core size, this is the maximum time that excess idle threads will wait for new tasks before terminating. It is used to avoid the overhead of creating a new thread.</p> <p>Let\u2019s understand this with an example:</p> <p>You have defined the core pool size as 5 and maximum pool size as 15 and all the 15 threads are getting used at the moment. </p> <p>Now when the threads are getting finished with their work, the excess 10 threads (15-5) become idle and eventually die. To avoid these 10 threads being killed too quickly, we can specify the keep alive time for these by using the keepAliveTime parameter in the ThreadPoolExecutor constructor. If you have given its value as 1 and time unit as TimeUnit.MINUTE, each thread will wait for 1 min after it had finished executing a task. Basically, it is waiting for a new task to be assigned. If it is not given any task, it would let itself complete. And in the end, the executor will be left with the core threads (5).</p> <ul> <li>BlockingQueue :   The queue to use for holding tasks before they are executed. This queue will hold only the Runnable tasks submitted by the execute method, you can use a ArrayBlockingQueue or LinkedBlockingQueue like:</li> </ul> <pre><code>BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;&gt;(100);\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>ThreadFactory :   The factory to use when the executor creates a new thread. Using thread factories removes hardwiring of calls to new Thread , enabling applications to use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>RejectedExecutionHandler : </p> </li> </ul> <p>This handler is used when a task is rejected by the executor because all the threads are busy and the queue is full.</p> <p>When this handler is not provided and the task submitted to execute() method is rejected, then an unchecked RejectedExecutionException is thrown. But adding a handler is a good practice to follow, there is a method:</p> <pre><code>void rejectedExecution(Runnable r , ThreadPoolExecutor executor );\n</code></pre> <p>This method will be invoked by ThreadPoolExecutor when execute() cannot accept a task. Putting it all together:</p> <pre><code>BlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt; blockingQueue = new ArrayBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;(50);\n        CustomThreadPoolExecutor executor = new CustomThreadPoolExecutor(5,15, 5000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, blockingQueue);\n        executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new RejectedExecutionHandler() {\n            @Override\n            public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor executor) {\n                System.out.println(\"Waiting for a second !!\");\n                try {\n                    Thread.sleep(1000);\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                    e.printStackTrace();\n                }\n                executor.execute(r);\n            }\n        });\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"java/multi-threading/#completablefuture","title":"CompletableFuture","text":"<p>CompletableFuture is used for asynchronous computation, where the code is executed as a non-blocking call in a separate thread and the result is made available when it is ready.</p> <p>Signature</p> <pre><code>public class CompletableFuture&lt;T&gt; extends Object implements Future&lt;T&gt;, CompletionStage&lt;T&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>CompletableFuture implements Future and CompletionStage interfaces and provides a huge set of convenience methods for creating, chaining and combining multiple Futures.

Problem with Future in Java is that the API is not that extensive you can just check whether the task is completed or cancelled using isDone() and isCancelled() method.

These expressions are particularly useful when working with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have a single abstract method.</p> <p>Here's the basic syntax of a lambda expression:</p> <pre><code>(parameters) -&gt; expression or block of code\n</code></pre> <p>Let's break down the components:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameters: These are the input parameters (if any) that your lambda expression takes. You can have zero or more parameters. If there's only one parameter and its type is inferred, you can omit the parentheses. For multiple parameters, parentheses are required.</p> </li> <li> <p>Arrow (-&gt;): The arrow separates the parameter list from the expression or block of code. It's the central symbol in a lambda expression.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expression or Block of Code: This is the code that the lambda expression encapsulates. It can be a single expression or a block of code enclosed in curly braces. If it's a block of code, you must use curly braces, and you may need to include a <code>return</code> statement if the block returns a value.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Let's see some practical examples:</p> <ol> <li>Lambda Expression with No Parameters:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   Runnable runnable = () -&gt; {\n       System.out.println(\"Hello from a lambda expression!\");\n   };\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Lambda Expression with One Parameter:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   (x) -&gt; x * x\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the lambda expression takes one parameter (<code>x</code>) and returns its square.</p> <ol> <li>Lambda Expression with Multiple Parameters:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   (a, b) -&gt; a + b\n</code></pre> <p>This lambda expression takes two parameters (<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>) and returns their sum.</p> <ol> <li>Lambda Expression as an Argument:</li> </ol> <p>Lambda expressions are often used as arguments to methods that accept functional interfaces. For example, the <code>forEach</code> method of a <code>List</code> accepts a <code>Consumer</code> functional interface:</p> <pre><code>   List&lt;String&gt; names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\n   names.forEach(name -&gt; System.out.println(\"Hello, \" + name));\n</code></pre> <p>Here, the lambda expression is used to define what should happen for each element in the list.</p> <p>Lambda expressions shine when you work with functional interfaces, such as <code>Runnable</code>, <code>Consumer</code>, <code>Predicate</code>, and others from the <code>java.util.function</code> package. They allow you to pass behavior as a parameter, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.</p> <p>In summary, lambda expressions in Java 8 are a concise way to define and use anonymous functions. They provide a clearer and more expressive way to work with functional interfaces, making your code more readable and flexible.</p>","tags":["Java 8"]},{"location":"java/java8/java8/#capturing-variables-in-lambda-expressions","title":"Capturing Variables in Lambda Expressions","text":"<p>Lambda expressions can also capture variables from their enclosing scope, making them extremely flexible. These variables can be either effectively final or final. An effectively final variable is one whose value doesn't change after it's assigned.</p> <p>Here's an example of capturing variables:</p> <pre><code>public void calculate(int a, int b) {\n    int result = 0; // Local variable\n    Operation operation = (x, y) -&gt; {\n        result = x + y; // Capturing 'result' from the outer scope\n        return result; // Using 'result' in the lambda expression\n    };\n\n    int sum = operation.perform(a, b);\n    System.out.println(\"Sum: \" + sum);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the lambda expression captures the <code>result</code> variable from the enclosing method's scope.

Method references are often used in conjunction with lambda expressions.</p> <p>There are four types of method references:</p> <ol> <li>Reference to a Static Method:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; parseInt = Integer::parseInt;\n</code></pre> <p>This example references the <code>parseInt</code> method of the <code>Integer</code> class.</p> <ol> <li>Reference to an Instance Method of a Particular Object:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   String str = \"Hello\";\n   Consumer&lt;String&gt; printer = str::println;\n</code></pre> <p>Here, <code>str::println</code> is a reference to the <code>println</code> method of the <code>str</code> object.</p> <ol> <li>Reference to an Instance Method of an Arbitrary Object of a Particular Type:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   List&lt;String&gt; names = Arrays.asList(\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\");\n   names.forEach(System.out::println);\n</code></pre> <p><code>System.out::println</code> is a reference to the <code>println</code> method of any <code>System.out</code> object.</p> <ol> <li>Reference to a Constructor:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   Supplier&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; listSupplier = ArrayList::new;\n</code></pre> <p>This example references the constructor of the <code>ArrayList</code> class.</p> <p>Method references provide a more concise way to express lambda expressions when you're simply calling a method or constructor, making your code even more readable.</p> <p>In conclusion, lambda expressions in Java 8 are a game-changer for writing concise and expressive code, especially when working with functional interfaces. They allow you to pass behavior as parameters and capture variables from their enclosing scope. When combined with method references, they offer a powerful toolset for writing clean and efficient code.

Here are some tips:</p> <ol> <li>Use Descriptive Variable Names: When defining lambda parameters, use meaningful and descriptive variable names. This makes it easier for others (and your future self) to understand the code.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   names.forEach(name -&gt; System.out.println(\"Hello, \" + name));\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, <code>name</code> is a clear and descriptive variable name.</p> <ol> <li>Keep Lambda Expressions Short: Lambda expressions should be concise and focused on a specific task. If a lambda expression becomes too long or complex, consider refactoring it into a separate method.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   // Avoid long and complex lambda expressions\n   names.forEach(name -&gt; {\n       if (name.length() &gt; 5) {\n           System.out.println(\"Long name: \" + name);\n       }\n   });\n\n   // Better: Extract the logic into a separate method\n   names.stream()\n        .filter(name -&gt; isLongName(name))\n        .forEach(name -&gt; System.out.println(\"Long name: \" + name));\n\n   // Define a method\n   private static boolean isLongName(String name) {\n       return name.length() &gt; 5;\n   }\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Consider Using Method References: When a lambda expression simply calls an existing method or constructor, consider using method references for clarity and brevity.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   // Lambda expression\n   Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; parseInt = s -&gt; Integer.parseInt(s);\n\n   // Method reference\n   Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; parseInt = Integer::parseInt;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Avoid Capturing Mutable Variables: Be cautious when capturing variables from an outer scope in lambda expressions, especially if those variables are mutable. Changes to mutable captured variables can lead to unexpected behavior.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   int counter = 0;\n   Runnable runnable = () -&gt; {\n       counter++; // Avoid capturing mutable variables\n   };\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Use Lambda Expressions with Streams: Lambda expressions work seamlessly with Java streams, allowing you to write functional and declarative code for operations on collections.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n\n   // Using lambda expressions with streams\n   int sum = numbers.stream()\n                   .filter(n -&gt; n % 2 == 0)\n                   .mapToInt(Integer::intValue)\n                   .sum();\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Know Your Functional Interfaces: Familiarize yourself with common functional interfaces from the <code>java.util.function</code> package, such as <code>Consumer</code>, <code>Predicate</code>, <code>Function</code>, etc. Understanding these interfaces will help you choose the appropriate one for your lambda expressions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Test and Debug: Lambda expressions, like any other code, should be thoroughly tested and debugged. Use unit tests and debugging tools to ensure their correctness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Document When Necessary: While lambda expressions can make your code more concise, avoid making it cryptic. When a lambda expression's purpose is not immediately obvious, consider adding comments or documentation to clarify its intent.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By following these best practices, you can make the most of lambda expressions in Java 8 while maintaining code readability and reliability.

They allow developers to write cleaner, more efficient code for tasks that can be parallelized, making Java applications faster and more scalable.</p> <p>Java 8 introduced the concept of streams, which provide a functional approach to working with collections of data. Parallel streams take this concept a step further by allowing you to harness the power of multiple cores in modern processors for improved performance. Here are the key benefits of using parallel streams in Java 8:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Improved Performance: Parallel streams enable you to perform operations on a collection of data in parallel, dividing the workload among multiple threads. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially when dealing with large datasets. For tasks that can be parallelized, you can expect faster execution times compared to sequential processing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Utilizing Multi-Core Processors: In today's computing environment, most machines come with multi-core processors. Parallel streams allow you to fully utilize these cores, making your Java applications more efficient. Each core can work on a portion of the data simultaneously, maximizing CPU resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cleaner and More Readable Code: Parallel streams promote cleaner and more readable code compared to traditional multithreading approaches. They abstract away the complexity of managing threads manually and allow you to express your intentions more clearly. This leads to code that is easier to maintain and understand.</p> </li> <li> <p>Conciseness: Parallel stream operations are concise and can often be written in a single line of code. This simplicity reduces the chances of introducing bugs and makes your codebase more concise and elegant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automatic Load Balancing: Parallel streams handle the distribution of tasks and load balancing automatically. Java's ForkJoinPool is used under the hood to split the work efficiently among available threads, ensuring that each thread gets a fair share of the work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Immutable Data: Parallel streams work seamlessly with immutable data structures. This encourages functional programming practices, reducing the risk of data inconsistencies caused by mutable data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Example - Calculating Sum of Numbers: Here's a simple example to illustrate the benefits of parallel streams. Suppose you have a large list of numbers and want to calculate their sum.</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>   List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10);\n\n   // Sequential Stream\n   int sumSequential = numbers.stream()\n       .reduce(0, (a, b) -&gt; a + b);\n\n   // Parallel Stream\n   int sumParallel = numbers.parallelStream()\n       .reduce(0, (a, b) -&gt; a + b);\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the parallel stream version can take advantage of multiple cores and perform the addition concurrently, potentially resulting in faster execution for large lists.</p> <p>In conclusion, parallel streams in Java 8 provide a powerful tool for improving the performance of your applications when dealing with data processing tasks that can be parallelized. They simplify concurrent programming, make the code more readable, and take advantage of modern hardware capabilities.

Data races and concurrency issues can occur if you modify shared data without proper synchronization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ordering: In some cases, parallel streams may not preserve the order of elements in the output. If maintaining order is crucial, consider using sequential streams or applying additional sorting operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Debugging Complexity: Debugging parallel code can be more challenging than debugging sequential code.

It involves the use of a dedicated component called the API Gateway to act as a single entry point for client requests and manage the communication between clients and the various Microservices within the system. The API Gateway pattern is important in Microservices for several reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Request Routing: The API Gateway handles incoming client requests and routes them to the appropriate Microservices. It acts as a traffic cop, ensuring that each request reaches the correct service, eliminating the need for clients to know the specific endpoints of individual services. This simplifies the client's interaction with the system.</p> </li> <li> <p>Load Balancing: The API Gateway can distribute incoming requests evenly among multiple instances of a Microservice, providing load balancing and ensuring that no single service instance is overwhelmed with traffic. This enhances the system's scalability and fault tolerance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication and Authorization: It can centralize authentication and authorization processes. The API Gateway can verify the identity of clients, validate their access rights, and enforce security policies, reducing the complexity of implementing security in each Microservice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Caching: An API Gateway can implement caching mechanisms to store frequently requested data or responses, reducing the load on Microservices and improving response times for clients. Caching can be particularly useful for read-heavy operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Aggregation: In cases where a client's request involves data from multiple Microservices, the API Gateway can aggregate the data and provide a consolidated response to the client. This reduces the number of client-server interactions, improving efficiency.</p> </li> <li> <p>Protocol Translation: Microservices may use different communication protocols or data formats. The API Gateway can perform protocol translation, allowing clients to use a standardized protocol, such as HTTP, while translating requests and responses to match the specific protocols of the underlying Microservices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Logging and Monitoring: Centralized logging and monitoring can be implemented within the API Gateway to track incoming requests, monitor service health, and capture performance metrics. This helps in debugging, troubleshooting, and ensuring system reliability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Version Management: API versioning can be managed at the API Gateway level, allowing for backward compatibility with older clients while introducing new features or changes to Microservices. This ensures that clients are not disrupted by service updates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Rate Limiting and Throttling: To prevent abuse or overloading of Microservices, the API Gateway can enforce rate limiting and request throttling policies, ensuring fair resource allocation among clients and protecting the system from denial-of-service attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduction of Cross-Cutting Concerns: The API Gateway abstracts cross-cutting concerns, such as security, logging, and monitoring, away from individual Microservices. This simplifies the development and maintenance of Microservices, allowing teams to focus on their core functionality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fault Tolerance: The API Gateway can help improve the overall fault tolerance of a Microservices system. It can implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers to handle transient failures gracefully. For example, if a Microservice temporarily becomes unavailable, the API Gateway can retry the request or provide a fallback response, ensuring a better user experience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consolidated Analytics: By centralizing request and response handling, the API Gateway can capture valuable analytics and metrics about client interactions. This data can be used for performance analysis, capacity planning, and making informed decisions about system optimizations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Client Development: Clients, whether web applications, mobile apps, or external services, benefit from a simplified and unified interface provided by the API Gateway. This simplification reduces the complexity of client-side development, as clients need to interact with a single entry point, rather than managing direct connections to numerous Microservices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cross-Cutting Concerns Enforcement: The API Gateway can enforce cross-cutting concerns, such as access control, logging, and content compression, consistently across all services. This ensures that important policies and practices are uniformly applied, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities and inconsistent behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scalability and Elasticity: When the API Gateway is designed for scalability, it can be scaled independently of Microservices. This means that as the system's traffic increases, you can scale the API Gateway to handle the load without necessarily scaling each Microservice. This approach optimizes resource allocation and cost-effectiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Testing and Documentation: With a single entry point for client interactions, testing and documenting the API become more straightforward. Clients can refer to well-documented API endpoints provided by the API Gateway, streamlining the integration process and reducing ambiguity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Change Management: When Microservices evolve or new services are added, the API Gateway can act as a shield for clients from disruptive changes. It can manage versioning, handle requests that need to be routed to the old or new versions, and ensure a smooth transition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simplified Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Handling: When dealing with client applications hosted on different domains, CORS becomes a concern. The API Gateway can manage CORS policies in a centralized manner, allowing or restricting cross-origin requests according to configured rules, thus simplifying cross-domain communication.</p> </li> <li> <p>Unified Error Handling: The API Gateway can standardize error responses and codes, making it easier for clients to understand and handle errors consistently. It can also provide detailed error messages and logs, aiding in debugging and troubleshooting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Enhanced Security Controls: Implementing security features like rate limiting, IP whitelisting, and DDoS protection is more manageable within the API Gateway. It provides a single point where security policies can be enforced, helping protect the entire Microservices ecosystem from threats and attacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service Transformation: The API Gateway can perform data transformation, including data format conversion and data enrichment, to tailor responses to clients' needs. This can reduce the burden on Microservices, which can focus on providing raw data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scalable and Centralized Middleware: Middleware components like caching, logging, and compression can be centrally managed within the API Gateway. This reduces the need to replicate these components across various Microservices and ensures consistent behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Reduced Network Overhead: By consolidating multiple requests into a single request or by caching responses, the API Gateway can reduce the overall network overhead and latency, resulting in improved system performance and responsiveness.</p> </li> <li> <p>Granular Access Control: The API Gateway can implement fine-grained access control policies, ensuring that only authorized clients can access specific services or endpoints. This adds an additional layer of security and control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Global Rate Limiting: In addition to per-service rate limiting, the API Gateway can apply global rate limits to prevent abuse of system resources. This helps maintain service quality and protects against misuse.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Configuration: API Gateway configurations can be dynamic and updated in real-time, allowing for on-the-fly changes to routing rules, security policies, and other settings without requiring Microservices redeployment.</p> </li> <li> <p>API Analytics and Insights: The API Gateway can collect detailed analytics and insights into how clients interact with the system. This information can be valuable for business intelligence, identifying trends, and making informed decisions.</p> </li> <li> <p>API Rate Limiting: API Gateway can enforce rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource allocation. This helps maintain system stability and prevents a single client or service from overwhelming the backend Microservices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO): API Gateway can handle authentication and SSO for clients, offloading the authentication process from individual Microservices. This centralization simplifies authentication management and improves security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Content Compression: The API Gateway can compress responses before sending them to clients, reducing bandwidth usage and improving overall performance, especially for clients with limited network resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distributed Tracing Integration: Integration with distributed tracing systems like Zipkin or Jaeger allows API Gateway to capture and trace requests across Microservices, providing insights into request flow and performance bottlenecks.</p> </li> <li> <p>A/B Testing and Canary Releases: API Gateway can facilitate A/B testing and canary releases by routing a subset of requests to specific Microservice versions. This enables controlled experimentation and gradual deployments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Request and Response Transformation: API Gateway can transform requests and responses, including data format conversion, filtering, and enrichment, ensuring that clients receive data in their preferred format or structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Global Error Handling: Centralized error handling in the API Gateway ensures that error responses are consistent and can be customized for different clients. It simplifies error management and reporting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consolidated Logging: Logging requests and responses at the API Gateway level provides a centralized view of system activities, simplifying troubleshooting and auditing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Service Composition: In cases where a client request requires data from multiple Microservices, API Gateway can orchestrate service composition, fetching data from multiple sources and aggregating responses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Resource Monitoring: API Gateway can monitor resource usage, performance, and health of Microservices, enabling proactive maintenance and scaling based on real-time data.</p> </li> <li> <p>WebSocket Handling: API Gateway can handle WebSocket connections and routing, allowing for real-time communication between clients and Microservices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Request Validation: API Gateway can validate incoming requests, ensuring that they adhere to predefined criteria and meet security standards before forwarding them to Microservices. This adds an additional layer of security and reduces the risk of malicious or malformed requests.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consolidated Metrics and Monitoring: API Gateway can collect and consolidate metrics and monitoring data from various Microservices. This aggregated information provides a comprehensive view of system performance and helps identify bottlenecks or issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Centralized Access Logging: Logging access events and audit trails at the API Gateway level allows for centralized access control and auditing. This is crucial for compliance with security and regulatory requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dynamic Routing and Load Balancing: API Gateway can dynamically adjust routing and load balancing strategies based on real-time traffic and Microservice health. It helps in optimizing resource allocation and ensuring high availability.</p> </li> <li> <p>API Documentation and Discovery: API Gateway can provide self-documentation of available services and endpoints, making it easier for developers to discover and understand the available APIs. This documentation can be generated automatically from Microservices metadata.</p> </li> <li> <p>Health Checking: API Gateway can perform health checks on Microservices, monitoring their availability and response times.

Instead, they run in the background, allowing your code to continue executing other tasks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Callback Function Structure: A callback is a function that you pass as an argument to another function that    performs an asynchronous operation. This callback function is executed once the operation is complete, serving as a    notification that the task has finished.</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>   // Example of using a callback for reading a file asynchronously\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (error, data) =&gt; {\n    if (error) {\n        console.error('Error reading the file: ', error);\n    } else {\n        console.log('File contents: ', data);\n    }\n});\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the <code>readFile</code> function takes a callback as its last argument. When the file reading operation is finished, the callback is executed with either an error or the read data.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Error Handling: Callbacks often receive an error as their first argument, which allows you to handle errors    gracefully. If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, you can check for it in the callback and take    appropriate action.</p> </li> <li> <p>Callback Hell (Callback Pyramid): When dealing with multiple asynchronous operations, nesting callbacks can lead    to complex and hard-to-read code. This is often referred to as \"Callback Hell\" or \"Callback Pyramid.\" To avoid this,    you can use techniques like Promises or async/await, which provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous code.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["Node.js","Node.js Releases","Node.js Versions","NPM (Node Package Manager)","Middleware","Promises","Express.js","RESTful API","Testing Strategies","Node.js Testing Strategies","Debugging Strategies","Performance Optimizing","Optimizing performance"]},{"location":"nodejs/#handling-callbacks-effectively","title":"Handling Callbacks Effectively:","text":"<p>To use callbacks effectively in Node.js, here are some best practices:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Modularize Your Code: Break down your code into smaller, reusable functions.

It acts as a bridge between the incoming HTTP request and the final response, allowing developers to perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, and data manipulation before the request reaches its destination.</p> <p>Middleware in Node.js is a fundamental concept, especially when building web applications using frameworks like Express.js. It plays a pivotal role in processing incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. Middleware functions are like building blocks that you can stack together to create a pipeline through which requests flow, with each middleware function performing a specific task or transformation.</p> <p>Here's a more detailed explanation of middleware in Node.js:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Request-Response Cycle: In a web application, when a client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a    server, that request goes through various stages before generating a response. Middleware functions intercept and    process the request and response during this cycle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Modular and Reusable: Middleware functions are modular and reusable pieces of code. Developers can write    middleware for specific tasks and reuse them across different routes and applications. This promotes code    organization and maintainability.</p> </li> <li> <p>Order of Execution: Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. The order matters because    each middleware can modify the request or response before passing it to the next middleware or the final request    handler.</p> </li> <li> <p>Common Middleware Tasks: Middleware can perform a wide range of tasks, including:</p> <ul> <li>Authentication: Checking if a user is logged in or has the necessary permissions before allowing access to   certain routes.</li> <li>Logging: Capturing information about incoming requests, such as IP addresses, timestamps, and request methods,   for debugging and monitoring purposes.</li> <li>Parsing Data: Parsing data from request bodies (e.g., JSON or form data) and making it available to route   handlers.</li> <li>Error Handling: Catching and handling errors that occur during request processing, ensuring that the   application doesn't crash.</li> <li>Caching: Storing frequently accessed data or responses in memory to improve performance.</li> <li>Compression: Compressing responses to reduce bandwidth usage.</li> <li>Routing: Determining which route handler should be called based on the request URL.</li> <li>Security: Implementing security measures, such as setting HTTP headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Express.js and Middleware: Express.js, a popular Node.js web framework, makes extensive use of middleware.    Middleware can be added to an Express application using the <code>app.use()</code> method or by specifying it for specific    routes. Express middleware can be built-in, third-party, or custom-written to suit your application's needs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next Function: Middleware functions typically accept three arguments: <code>request</code>, <code>response</code>, and <code>next</code>.    The <code>next</code> function is a callback that must be called to pass control to the next middleware in the chain. If <code>next</code>    is not called, the request will not progress to the subsequent middleware or route handler.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here's a simple example of how middleware is used in Express.js to log incoming requests:</p> <pre><code>const express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// Custom middleware to log requests\napp.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`Request received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler\n});\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {\n    res.send('Hello, World!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () =&gt; {\n    console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');\n});\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the custom middleware logs incoming requests before allowing them to proceed to the route handler.</p> <p>In summary, middleware in Node.js, particularly when used with frameworks like Express.js, is a powerful tool for handling various aspects of request processing in web applications.

These can be easily added to your application    using <code>app.use()</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third-party Middleware: The Node.js community offers a wide range of third-party middleware packages that extend    the functionality of your application. These include authentication middleware like Passport.js, request validation    middleware like Joi or express-validator, and many others. You can incorporate these packages into your application    to leverage their features.</p> </li> <li> <p>Custom Middleware: You can create your custom middleware functions tailored to your application's specific needs.    These functions can perform tasks unique to your project, such as logging, error handling, or data transformation.    Custom middleware allows you to maintain full control over the request-response cycle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Error Handling Middleware: Specialized middleware can be dedicated to error handling. These middleware functions    are defined with four parameters (<code>err</code>, <code>req</code>, <code>res</code>, and <code>next</code>) and are used to catch and handle errors that occur    in your application. Error handling middleware ensures that your application remains robust and doesn't crash due to    unhandled exceptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Authentication Middleware: Authentication middleware is vital for securing your application. It verifies the    identity of users based on their credentials or tokens and grants or denies access to protected routes. Passport.js    is a popular choice for implementing authentication middleware in Node.js applications.</p> </li> <li> <p>Routing Middleware: Routing middleware is responsible for determining which route handler should be executed    based on the incoming request's URL and HTTP method. Express.js uses routing middleware to match incoming requests to    the appropriate route handlers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security Middleware: Security middleware adds an extra layer of protection to your application by setting    security-related HTTP headers, preventing common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site    Request Forgery (CSRF), and implementing rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["Node.js","Node.js Releases","Node.js Versions","NPM (Node Package Manager)","Middleware","Promises","Express.js","RESTful API","Testing Strategies","Node.js Testing Strategies","Debugging Strategies","Performance Optimizing","Optimizing performance"]},{"location":"nodejs/#middleware-execution-order","title":"Middleware Execution Order:","text":"<p>Understanding the order in which middleware functions are executed is crucial for building reliable applications:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Top-down Order: Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined using the <code>app.use()</code> method or    within specific route handlers.

Here are some key best practices for working with middleware:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use Middleware Sparingly: While middleware is a powerful tool, it's important not to overuse it. Only add    middleware that serves a specific purpose in your application. Overloading your application with unnecessary    middleware can impact performance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Order Matters: Pay careful attention to the order in which you add middleware. The sequence of middleware    functions can significantly affect how requests are processed. For example, authentication middleware should be    placed before route-specific middleware to ensure that authentication is checked first.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep Middleware Functions Simple: Each middleware function should have a clear and specific purpose. Avoid    creating monolithic middleware functions that try to do too much. Smaller, focused middleware functions are easier to    understand and maintain.</p> </li> <li> <p>Middleware Composition: You can compose multiple middleware functions into a single middleware function using    the <code>app.use()</code> method. This can help reduce redundancy and improve code organization. For example:</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>   const logRequest = (req, res, next) =&gt; {\n    console.log(`Request received: ${req.method} ${req.url}`);\n    next();\n};\n\nconst parseJSON = express.json();\n\napp.use(logRequest, parseJSON);\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Error Handling Middleware: Ensure that your application has error handling middleware in place to catch and    handle errors gracefully. This prevents unhandled exceptions from crashing your server and provides meaningful error    responses to clients.</p> </li> <li> <p>Middleware Testing: Test your middleware functions thoroughly. Middleware can have a significant impact on the    behavior of your application, so it's crucial to ensure that it functions as expected. Use testing frameworks like    Mocha and Chai or Jest to write unit tests for your middleware.</p> </li> <li> <p>Middleware Versioning: If you make changes to your middleware, consider versioning it to avoid breaking existing    functionality for other parts of your application that depend on it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Existing Middleware Libraries: Whenever possible, leverage existing, well-maintained middleware libraries    from the Node.js ecosystem. These libraries have often been tested in production environments and may offer more    robust solutions than custom implementations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keep Security in Mind: Be cautious when using third-party middleware, especially those that manipulate request    data. Ensure that the middleware you use is secure and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities to your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Documentation: Document your middleware functions and their usage. Clear documentation helps other developers on     your team understand how to use and extend the middleware in your application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Regular Maintenance: Keep your middleware up to date with the latest versions and security patches. Outdated     middleware can pose security risks and compatibility issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Middleware Naming Conventions: Establish clear naming conventions for your middleware functions to make it     easier for developers to identify their purpose. For example, prefix middleware functions with terms like \"auth\" for     authentication middleware or \"logger\" for logging middleware.</p> </li> </ol> <p>By following these best practices, you can effectively work with middleware in your Node.js applications, ensuring that it enhances your application's functionality while maintaining code quality and security.

This server stores session   data and issues a unique session identifier (e.g., a session ID) to the client upon login.</li> <li>Each subsequent request from the client includes this session ID, allowing the server to retrieve the associated   session data.</li> <li>Popular tools for server-side session management in Node.js include:<ul> <li>Express-Session: This middleware for the Express.js web framework allows you to store session data in   various backends, including in-memory, databases, or external stores like Redis.</li> <li>Redis: A fast in-memory data store that can be used to store session data. It's often employed in   distributed environments due to its speed and reliability.</li> <li>MongoDB: You can use MongoDB or other databases to store session data. This approach provides persistence   and scalability but may introduce some latency.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWT):</p> <ul> <li>JWTs are self-contained tokens that can store session-related data securely. These tokens can be generated on the   server and sent to the client, which includes them in subsequent requests.</li> <li>JWTs can be used for authentication and authorization and can eliminate the need for server-side session storage   in some cases.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Session Clustering:</p> <ul> <li>When deploying Node.js in a distributed environment, you can set up session clustering, where multiple Node.js   instances share session data.</li> <li>Tools like Connect-Redis or connect-mongo allow you to store sessions in Redis or MongoDB, respectively,   and share them among Node.js instances.</li> <li>This approach provides redundancy and load balancing but may require additional setup and management.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Third-Party Services:</p> <ul> <li>Consider using third-party services like AWS Elasticache (for Redis) or Azure Cache for Redis to manage session   state. These managed services offer scalability and reliability without the need for manual maintenance.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Token-Based Authentication:</p> <ul> <li>Instead of traditional session management, you can implement token-based authentication. In this approach, clients   include authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) in each request, eliminating the need for server-side session state.</li> <li>This approach works well for stateless APIs and microservices architectures.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Load Balancer Configuration:</p> <ul> <li>If you're using a load balancer, ensure that it supports sticky sessions (also known as session affinity).

Node.js provides methods like <code>process.nextTick()</code>, <code>setImmediate()</code>, and <code>setInterval()</code> to control when    certain tasks are executed. These can be useful for fine-tuning the order of execution of callbacks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Blocking Code: Although Node.js is designed to be non-blocking, you should be cautious when using synchronous    code or CPU-intensive operations within your callbacks. Such code can block the event loop and affect the overall    performance of your application. Consider offloading CPU-intensive tasks to worker threads or child processes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Memory Management: Asynchronous operations in Node.js can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. It's    important to release resources and remove references to objects when they are no longer needed. Tools like the    built-in <code>EventEmitter</code> class can help manage event subscriptions and prevent memory leaks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Error Handling: Proper error handling is crucial in asynchronous code. Always handle errors within your    callbacks, and consider using libraries like <code>async/await</code> or Promises to simplify error handling and avoid unhandled    exceptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Loop Lag: In high-traffic applications, the event loop can become congested, leading to event loop lag.    Monitor your application's performance and consider load balancing or scaling strategies to address this issue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Concurrency and Thread Safety: While Node.js is single-threaded, it is designed to be concurrent. Ensure that    your code is thread-safe when sharing resources among multiple asynchronous operations. Proper synchronization    mechanisms may be necessary in certain scenarios.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Loop Debugging: Node.js provides built-in debugging tools and libraries like <code>async_hooks</code> for tracing and    debugging the event loop. Familiarize yourself with these tools to troubleshoot performance or concurrency issues.</p> </li> <li> <p>Event Loop Libraries: Explore third-party libraries and tools designed to work with the event loop. Libraries    like <code>p-event</code> and <code>event-loop-inspector</code> can help manage event-driven code and provide insights into event loop    behavior.</p> </li> <li> <p>Node.js Versions: Be aware of changes and improvements in different Node.js versions. Upgrade to newer versions    to benefit from performance enhancements, bug fixes, and security updates.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In conclusion, understanding the event loop in Node.js is essential for building efficient and scalable applications. It enables you to leverage asynchronous programming to handle I/O operations and concurrency effectively. By mastering the event loop and considering customization options and best practices, you can create robust and high-performance Node.js applications that can handle a wide range of tasks and workloads.</p>","tags":["Event Loop","Event-Driven Architecture"]},{"location":"nodejs/eventloop/#microtasks-and-macrotasks-in-the-event-loop","title":"Microtasks and Macrotasks in the Event Loop","text":"<p>In the context of the event loop in JavaScript, tasks can be categorized into two main types: microtasks and macrotasks.

Handle Redirects and Route Guards (Optional):</p> <ul> <li>Implement any necessary redirects or route guards by conditionally rendering components or dispatching actions based on the routing state.</li> </ul> <p>8. Advanced Routing (Optional):</p> <ul> <li>Depending on your application's complexity, you may need to implement more advanced routing features, such as nested routes, route parameters, or custom route matching logic.

Route Configuration:</p> <ul> <li>In larger applications, you can create a separate configuration file for your routes, defining routes as objects with properties like <code>path</code>, <code>component</code>, and any route-specific data.</li> </ul> <pre><code>   // routes.js\n   export const routes = [\n     { path: '/', component: Home },\n     { path: '/about', component: About },\n     { path: '/contact', component: Contact },\n     // Add more routes here\n   ];\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Then, you can map over the <code>routes</code> array to dynamically generate the <code>Route</code> components.</li> </ul> <pre><code>   // App.js\n   import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n   import { routes } from './routes';\n\n   const App = () =&gt; {\n     // ...\n\n     return (\n       &lt;Router&gt;\n         &lt;div&gt;\n           &lt;nav&gt;\n             &lt;ul&gt;\n               {routes.map((route) =&gt; (\n                 &lt;li key={route.path} onClick={() =&gt; dispatch(navigateTo(route.path))}&gt;\n                   {route.path === currentPath ? &lt;strong&gt;{route.path}&lt;/strong&gt; : route.path}\n                 &lt;/li&gt;\n               ))}\n             &lt;/ul&gt;\n           &lt;/nav&gt;\n           &lt;Switch&gt;\n             {routes.map((route) =&gt; (\n               &lt;Route key={route.path} path={route.path} exact&gt;\n                 &lt;route.component /&gt;\n               &lt;/Route&gt;\n             ))}\n           &lt;/Switch&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n       &lt;/Router&gt;\n     );\n   };\n</code></pre> <p>10. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:</p> <ul> <li>To optimize your application's performance, consider implementing code splitting and lazy loading for route components. This ensures that only the necessary JavaScript is loaded for each route, reducing the initial bundle size.</li> </ul> <pre><code>   // Using React.lazy and Suspense for lazy loading\n   import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n\n   const Home = lazy(() =&gt; import('./Home'));\n   const About = lazy(() =&gt; import('./About'));\n   const Contact = lazy(() =&gt; import('./Contact'));\n\n   const App = () =&gt; {\n     // ...\n\n     return (\n       &lt;Router&gt;\n         &lt;div&gt;\n           {/* ... */}\n           &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;\n             {routes.map((route) =&gt; (\n               &lt;Route key={route.path} path={route.path} exact&gt;\n                 &lt;route.component /&gt;\n               &lt;/Route&gt;\n             ))}\n           &lt;/Suspense&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n       &lt;/Router&gt;\n     );\n   };\n</code></pre> <p>11. Protecting Routes (Authentication):</p> <ul> <li>If your application requires route protection (e.g., authentication), you can implement route guards using Redux and React Router. Check the user's authentication status in the Redux store and conditionally render or redirect based on their access rights.</li> </ul> <p>12. Handling Nested Routes (Optional):</p> <ul> <li>For applications with nested route structures (e.g., dashboard with sub-routes), you can nest <code>Route</code> components within other components to handle the hierarchy.</li> </ul> <pre><code>   // App.js\n   import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';\n   import { routes } from './routes';\n\n   const App = () =&gt; {\n     // ...\n\n     return (\n       &lt;Router&gt;\n         &lt;div&gt;\n           {/* ... */}\n           &lt;Switch&gt;\n             {routes.map((route) =&gt; (\n               &lt;Route key={route.path} path={route.path} exact&gt;\n                 &lt;Layout&gt;\n                   &lt;route.component /&gt;\n                 &lt;/Layout&gt;\n               &lt;/Route&gt;\n             ))}\n           &lt;/Switch&gt;\n         &lt;/div&gt;\n       &lt;/Router&gt;\n     );\n   };\n</code></pre> <p>These additional steps and considerations enhance the routing functionality in your Redux-based application.

Middleware can be added when creating the Redux store using the <code>applyMiddleware</code> function.</p> <p>Here's an example of adding middleware to your store and dispatching an action:</p> <pre><code>   import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';\n   import rootReducer from './reducers';\n   import someMiddleware from './middleware'; // Import your middleware\n\n   const store = createStore(\n     rootReducer,\n     applyMiddleware(someMiddleware) // Add your middleware here\n   );\n\n   // Dispatch an action with middleware applied\n   store.dispatch(incrementAction);\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Testing:</li> </ol> <p>Actions are relatively easy to test because they are pure functions that produce predictable results based on their input. You can write unit tests to ensure that actions are creating the expected action objects with the correct <code>type</code> and <code>payload</code>. Testing actions is an essential part of ensuring that your Redux application behaves as expected.</p> <p>In summary, dispatching an action in Redux involves using the <code>dispatch</code> function provided by the Redux store to send an action object to the store. This action object describes an intent to change the state and typically includes a <code>type</code> property that specifies the action type and an optional <code>payload</code> to provide additional data.

The key to managing state in Redux is to follow a strict unidirectional data flow. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the state updates in Redux:</p> <ol> <li>Dispatching an Action:</li> </ol> <p>The process begins when an action is dispatched. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes an intention to change the state of the application. Actions contain a <code>type</code> property that defines the type of action and an optional <code>payload</code> property to provide additional data.</p> <pre><code>   dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER', payload: 1 });\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the action is dispatched with the type <code>'INCREMENT_COUNTER'</code> and a payload of <code>1</code>, indicating the intent to increment a counter by 1.</p> <ol> <li>Action Propagation:</li> </ol> <p>Once an action is dispatched using the <code>dispatch</code> function, Redux ensures that the action is propagated to all registered reducers. Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state should change in response to actions.</p> <ol> <li>Reducer Processing:</li> </ol> <p>Each reducer in the application receives the dispatched action. Reducers are responsible for examining the action's <code>type</code> and, if necessary, its <code>payload</code>. Based on the action type, a reducer decides how to update the state.</p> <pre><code>   const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) =&gt; {\n     switch (action.type) {\n       case 'INCREMENT_COUNTER':\n         return state + action.payload;\n       case 'DECREMENT_COUNTER':\n         return state - action.payload;\n       default:\n         return state; // No change for other actions\n     }\n   };\n</code></pre> <p>In this example, the <code>counterReducer</code> processes the <code>'INCREMENT_COUNTER'</code> and <code>'DECREMENT_COUNTER'</code> actions by updating the counter value based on the payload.</p> <ol> <li>Immutable State Update:</li> </ol> <p>Redux enforces the principle of immutability. This means that reducers should not directly modify the existing state, but instead, they should create a new state object that reflects the desired changes. Immutability ensures that the previous state remains intact, allowing for time-travel debugging and predictable state management.</p> <pre><code>   case 'INCREMENT_COUNTER':\n     return state + action.payload; // Create and return a new state object\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Root Reducer Composition (Optional):</li> </ol> <p>In larger Redux applications, you might have multiple reducers, each responsible for a specific slice of the application's state. To manage these reducers, you can use the <code>combineReducers</code> function to create a root reducer. The root reducer combines the output of individual reducers into a single state object.</p> <ol> <li>State Update:</li> </ol> <p>After processing the action, reducers return the updated state. Redux combines the output of all reducers (if you have a root reducer) to create the new state object. The new state reflects the changes specified by the action and the logic within the reducers.</p> <ol> <li>Subscribed Components Update:</li> </ol> <p>React components or other parts of your application that are subscribed to the Redux store are automatically updated when the state changes. This is typically achieved using hooks like <code>useSelector</code> in React. When the state is updated, these components re-render to reflect the new state.</p> <pre><code>   const counter = useSelector((state) =&gt; state.counter); // Read state from the store\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Rendering Updated UI:</li> </ol> <p>As a result of the state update, React components re-render with the new data from the Redux store. This ensures that the user interface (UI) remains consistent with the application's state.</p> <ol> <li>User Interaction and Further Actions:</li> </ol> <p>The cycle continues as users interact with the application. When they perform actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, or triggering events, new actions are dispatched, and the process repeats, leading to further state updates.</p> <p>By following this unidirectional data flow, Redux ensures that the state updates are clear, predictable, and organized. It also simplifies debugging and testing, as you can trace how actions influence the state of your application and maintain a single source of truth for your data.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Middleware (Optional):</p> <p>In more complex Redux applications, you might introduce middleware to handle tasks such as logging, asynchronous operations, and more. Middleware can intercept actions before they reach the reducers, allowing you to perform additional tasks or transformations on the actions or the state.</p> <p>Middleware can be inserted into the dispatch process, either globally or on a per-action basis, depending on your needs. It can modify actions, dispatch multiple actions, or even cancel actions.</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>   // Using Redux Thunk middleware to handle asynchronous actions\n   dispatch(fetchData()); // Dispatch an action that initiates an async operation\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Logging and Debugging:</p> <p>Redux provides powerful tools for logging and debugging state changes. Tools like Redux DevTools allow you to inspect dispatched actions, view the state at different points in time, and even \"time-travel\" to previous states to understand how your application's state evolved. The <code>dispatch</code> function is a crucial part of this debugging process, as it records and manages the flow of actions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat as Necessary:</p> <p>The process of dispatching actions, processing them through reducers, and updating the state can repeat many times as users interact with your application. Each action dispatch corresponds to a specific user interaction or event, and Redux ensures that these interactions lead to predictable state updates.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, the state updates in Redux through a clear and controlled process that revolves around the dispatching of actions. Actions describe the intent to change the state, reducers determine how the state should change, and the state update process is managed by Redux, ensuring that the state remains predictable and organized. This unidirectional data flow is a fundamental concept in Redux, enabling efficient state management in complex web applications.</p> <p>Redux and React's built-in state management are two distinct approaches to managing the state of a React application. Here are the key differences between them:</p> <ol> <li> <p>State Management Library:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux is a standalone state management library that can be used with any JavaScript framework or library, not just React. It follows the Flux architecture pattern and provides a centralized store to manage application state.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State refers to managing state using React's built-in features like <code>useState</code> and <code>useReducer</code>. It is specific to React and doesn't require an external library.</p> </li> <li> <p>Architecture:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux enforces a strict unidirectional data flow and follows the Flux architecture. It separates state management from components and encourages a clear separation of concerns.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State allows for a more flexible approach to state management, where state can be managed within individual components. While it encourages local component state, it can lead to complex state management as the application grows.</p> </li> <li> <p>Centralized vs. Local State:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux uses a centralized store to manage the entire application's state. All components access and update the state from the same source.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State allows each component to manage its own local state using the <code>useState</code> or <code>useReducer</code> hooks. This local state is encapsulated within the component and doesn't directly affect other components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Predictability:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux provides a high level of predictability because it enforces a strict unidirectional data flow. Debugging and understanding how state changes occur are often easier with Redux due to its clear structure.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State can become less predictable as the application grows because state management is distributed across multiple components. It may require more effort to track and understand how state changes propagate.</p> </li> <li> <p>Complexity:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux can introduce additional complexity, especially for small to medium-sized applications, due to the overhead of setting up actions, reducers, and a centralized store.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State is simpler to set up and often requires less boilerplate code, making it more suitable for smaller applications or simple components.</p> </li> <li> <p>Middleware and Side Effects:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux has a well-defined ecosystem for handling middleware and side effects, such as Redux Thunk or Redux Saga. These libraries make it easier to manage asynchronous operations and side effects.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State doesn't have built-in support for middleware or side effects. You may need to manage asynchronous operations and side effects separately or use third-party libraries like Axios or the <code>useEffect</code> hook.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learning Curve:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux has a steeper learning curve, especially for beginners, due to its strict architecture and the concepts of actions, reducers, and stores.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State is easier to grasp, making it more accessible for developers new to React.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use Cases:</p> </li> <li> <p>Redux is well-suited for complex applications with a large amount of shared state, multiple components that need access to the same data, or applications with intricate data flow requirements.</p> </li> <li> <p>React's Built-in State is often sufficient for smaller applications or components with relatively simple state management needs. It's ideal for encapsulating state within a single component.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, the choice between Redux and React's built-in state management depends on the specific needs of your project. Redux offers a structured and centralized approach suitable for complex applications, while React's built-in state management provides simplicity and ease of use for smaller-scale projects or components. You may also consider factors such as the learning curve, application size, and the need for predictable state management when making your decision.</p>","tags":["Redux","State","Middleware Support","Unidirectional Data Flow"]},{"location":"react/redux/#optimizing-the-performance-of-a-redux-application","title":"Optimizing the performance of a Redux application","text":"<p>Optimizing the performance of a Redux application is essential to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

Here are some best practices for handling API calls in React:</p> <p>1. Use a Centralized Service or API Module:</p> <ul> <li>Create a dedicated module or service for managing API calls. This central location can encapsulate the logic related to API endpoints, headers, and authentication. It makes it easier to maintain and update API-related code.</li> </ul> <p>2. Handle Errors Gracefully:</p> <ul> <li>Implement robust error handling for API calls. Use <code>try...catch</code> blocks or <code>.catch()</code> for Promises to handle network errors and server responses with appropriate error messages. Provide meaningful feedback to users when errors occur.</li> </ul> <p>3. Use Asynchronous JavaScript:</p> <ul> <li>Always make API calls asynchronously to prevent blocking the main thread. Use <code>async/await</code> with <code>fetch</code>, Axios, or other HTTP libraries to write cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.</li> </ul> <p>4. Avoid Excessive API Requests:</p> <ul> <li>Minimize unnecessary API requests. Cache data when possible, and consider implementing client-side data storage solutions like Redux or React's built-in state management to reduce redundant API calls.</li> </ul> <p>5. Implement Loading Indicators:</p> <ul> <li>Show loading indicators (e.g., spinners) while waiting for API responses. This provides feedback to users and improves the user experience.</li> </ul> <p>6. Use Environment Variables:</p> <ul> <li>Store sensitive information like API keys, tokens, or URLs in environment variables or configuration files. Avoid hardcoding these values directly into your code, especially if your application is open source or needs to run in different environments.</li> </ul> <p>7. Implement Request Cancelation:</p> <ul> <li>If your application allows users to navigate away from a page or component while an API call is in progress, consider implementing request cancelation to prevent unnecessary network activity and potential race conditions.</li> </ul> <p>8. Test API Calls:</p> <ul> <li>Write unit tests and integration tests for API calls. Use mocking libraries or stubs to simulate API responses during testing. Ensure that your tests cover different response scenarios, including success and error cases.</li> </ul> <p>9. Manage API Tokens Securely:</p> <ul> <li>If your API requires tokens or authentication, handle tokens securely. Avoid exposing tokens in client-side code. Consider using secure authentication flows like OAuth 2.0 or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.</li> </ul> <p>10. Monitor API Usage:</p> <ul> <li>Implement logging and monitoring for API calls to track performance, errors, and usage patterns. This can help you identify and resolve issues proactively.</li> </ul> <p>11. Optimize Network Requests:</p> <ul> <li>Minimize the size of network requests by only requesting the necessary data from the server. Implement server-side pagination, filtering, and sorting to reduce the amount of data transferred.</li> </ul> <p>12. Implement Retry and Backoff Strategies:</p> <ul> <li>Consider implementing retry and backoff strategies for failed API requests to handle temporary network issues or server failures. This can improve the resilience of your application.</li> </ul> <p>13. Use Authentication Libraries:</p> <ul> <li>If your application requires user authentication, consider using authentication libraries or frameworks (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Authentication) to simplify the authentication process.</li> </ul> <p>14. Version Your APIs:</p> <ul> <li>If you have control over the API, version it to ensure backward compatibility as you make changes and updates. This helps prevent breaking changes for existing clients.</li> </ul> <p>15. Document Your API Usage:</p> <ul> <li>Maintain clear documentation for how your React components interact with APIs. This documentation can serve as a reference for developers working on the project.</li> </ul> <p>By following these best practices, you can create a more reliable and maintainable React application that efficiently communicates with external APIs while providing a seamless user experience.

It hides the basic steps of these technologies. Let's take the example of JdbcTemplate, you don't need to write the code for exception handling, creating connection, creating statement, committing transaction, closing connection etc. You need to write the code of executing query only. Thus, it save a lot of JDBC code. Loose Coupling The Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection. Easy to test The Dependency Injection makes easier to test the application. The EJB or Struts application require server to run the application but Spring framework doesn't require server. Lightweight Spring framework is lightweight because of its POJO implementation. The Spring Framework doesn't force the programmer to inherit any class or implement any interface. That is why it is said non-invasive. Fast Development The Dependency Injection feature of Spring Framework and it support to various frameworks makes the easy development of JavaEE application.

Suppose there are 4 properties in a class and the class has setter methods and a constructor with 4 parameters. In this case, if you want to inject only one/two property, then it is only possible with setter methods (unless you can define a new parametrized constructor with the needed properties) - Cyclic dependency is also not possible with Constructor based injection. Suppose class A has dependency on class B and class B has dependency on class A and we are using constructor based injection, then when Spring tries to create object of class A, it sees that it needs class B object, then it tries to resolve that dependency first. But when it tries to create object of class B, it finds that it needs class A object, which is still under construction. Here Spring recognizes that a circular reference may have occurred and you will get an error in this case. This problem can easily be solved by using Setter based injection because dependencies are not injected at the object creation time - While using Constructor injection, you will have to remember the order of parameters in a constructor when the number of constructor parameters increases. This is not the case with Setter injection - Constructor injection helps in creating immutable objects, because a bean object is created using constructor and once the object is created, its dependencies cannot be altered anymore.

So, whenever the method annotated with <code>@Transactional</code> is called, the request first comes to the proxy object and this proxy object invokes the same method on the target bean. These proxy objects can be supplied with interceptors. Spring creates a TransactionInterceptor and passes it to the generated proxy object. So, when the <code>@Transactional</code> annotated method is called, it gets called on the proxy object first, which in turn invokes the TransactionInterceptor that begins a transaction. Then the proxy object calls the actual method of the target bean. When the method finishes, the TransactionInterceptor commits/rollbacks the transaction.</p> <p>One thing to remember here is that the Spring wraps the bean in the proxy, the bean has no knowledge of it. So, only the external calls go through the proxy. As for the internal calls (<code>@Transactional</code> method calling the same bean method), they are called using \u2018this\u2019.

But there are two shape implementations are there Rectangle and Circle. So spring doesn't get a proper solution for what component need to autowire. Then the spring check the name of the variable(rectangle) and find out any Shape component with the same name is available. Yes\u2026The Rectangle component is available. So the spring will inject the property with rectangle component. 2. In the second @Autowiring, the type of property is Rectangle.

It provides a set of conventions, templates, and tools that make it easier to create stand-alone, production-ready applications with minimal manual configuration.  Here's a detailed explanation with examples to help you understand Spring Boot better:</p> <p>1. Simplified Configuration: - Spring Boot reduces the need for complex XML configuration files that were common in traditional Spring applications. It uses sensible defaults, so you can get started quickly without much configuration. - Example: In a Spring Boot application, you can define database connection properties in a single <code>application.properties</code> or <code>application.yml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\nspring.datasource.username=root\nspring.datasource.password=secret\n</code></pre> <p>2. Embedded Servers: - Spring Boot includes embedded web servers (like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) that allow you to package your application as a standalone executable JAR or WAR file. You don't need to deploy your application to a separate server. - Example: To include an embedded Tomcat server in your project, just add the following dependency to your <code>pom.xml</code> or <code>build.gradle</code>:</p> <pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>3. Spring Boot Starters: - Starters are pre-configured templates for various application types, such as web, data, messaging, etc. They include all the necessary dependencies to get you started quickly. - Example: To create a web application, include the <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code> starter, as shown above. It automatically includes dependencies for Spring MVC, Tomcat, and other related libraries.</p> <p>4. Auto-Configuration: - Spring Boot offers auto-configuration, which means it automatically configures your application based on the classpath and libraries you include. - Example: If you include the H2 database driver on your classpath, Spring Boot will configure an in-memory H2 database for you without any additional setup.</p> <p>5.

Here's a detailed comparison between TypeScript and JavaScript:</p> <ol> <li>Static Typing: TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing you to specify the data types of variables. This helps catch type-related errors during development, enhancing code reliability. For example:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   let age: number = 30;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Strong Typing: TypeScript enforces stricter type checking compared to JavaScript. This can prevent unexpected type conversions or operations. For instance:</li> </ol> <pre><code>   let name: string = \"John\";\n   name = 123; // Error: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Interfaces and Classes: TypeScript supports interfaces and classes, making it easier to define custom data structures and create object-oriented code.</li> </ol> <pre><code>   interface Person {\n     name: string;\n     age: number;\n   }\n\n   class Student implements Person {\n     constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}\n   }\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Advanced Tooling: TypeScript offers robust tooling with features like auto-completion, code navigation, and refactoring support in modern development environments like Visual Studio Code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compilation: TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript before execution, allowing you to use the latest JavaScript features while targeting specific ECMAScript versions.</p> </li> </ol>","tags":["TypeScript","Interfaces vs Classes","Static Typing","Declare Variables","Type Assertion","Generics in TypeScript","Decorators","Access Modifiers"]},{"location":"typescript/#javascript","title":"JavaScript:","text":"<ol> <li>Dynamic Typing: JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning variables can change their data type during runtime.
